title: Subset Generation Problem
---

# Given a set represented as string, write a recursive code to print all subsets of it. The subsets can be printed in any order.

The method which I prefer for solving the above question is to use a sliding window.
Here suppose I have a string ( a character array ) of size N.

**Step 1**: Call a loop with s=0 and e= N-1 and then increase the value of s till N-1

**Step 2**: Check condition s<=e (See Line 33)

**Step 3**: Now for each window we add a `"` in the beginning. (See Line 34).

**Step 4**: Now let `i` be equal to `s` and run a loop from i=0 (=s initially) till e and gather all the elements, when
the loop is over. Add a `"` at the end. (See Line 37).

**Step 5**: Now again call the Recursive Function keep `s` as it is and decreasing `e` by 1 unit. Then again the whole process runs and
answer is printed.

**Step 6**: So from Step 1 to Step 5 we have kept s=0 e= N-1 printed all, s=0 e= N-2 printed all, s=0 e=N-3 printed all.

**Step 7**: So we have to do this for s=1 to s= N-1 also, we did this in the `main()` function. (See Line 48). We add a newline for next cases.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
// Generation of subsets of a string

void Subset(char str[], int s, int e, int size)
{
if(s<=e)
 { printf("\"");
    for(int i=s;i<=e;i++)
    {printf("%c",str[i]);}
 printf("\"");
 Subset(str,s,e-1,size); }
else
 return;
}
int main(void)
{   char name[3]= "animesh";
    int size = sizeof(name)/sizeof(name[0]);
    printf("size is %d\n",size);
    for(int l=0;l<=size-1;l++)
    {Subset(name,l,size-1,size);
     printf("\n");
    }
    printf("\" \" "); //Also print an empty string because an empty string is a subset of all strings
    return 0;
}
```


Result

```
"animesh""animes""anime""anim""ani""an""a"
"nimesh""nimes""nime""nim""ni""n"
"imesh""imes""ime""im""i"
"mesh""mes""me""m"
"esh""es""e"
"sh""s"
"h"
" "
```
