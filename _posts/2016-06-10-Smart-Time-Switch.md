The project presents the development of timed switching system. A general belief in our world regarding devices is that people think that turning off an electrical appliance while it is still plugged in does not consume any power. However, some electrical appliances actually never turn off and these still consume power in the standby mode. 

Standby mode draws Standby Power, Standby power is electrical power used by appliances and equipment while switched off or not performing their primary function, often waiting to be activated by a remote controller. That power is consumed by internal or external power supplies, remote control receivers, text or light displays, circuits energized when the device is plugged in even when switched off,
etc. Power can be saved by disconnecting such devices, causing at worst only inconvenience. Also, many times people ignore and forget to unplug the phone and laptop chargers even if the phone/ laptop is fully charged. Even though the power loss due to this is nearly 1 watt, if multiple devices are left (say 50 devices) then the power loss shall be equal to 50 watts which is quite significant.

To help reduce this power loss, a “timed switching system” prototype and smart energy meter system linked with Intel Galileo Gen 2 will be used to time a particular electric switch. This lets the power supply of an appliance connected to the switch to turn off and thus avoids the excess power loss by electric leakage. The switches can also be remotely accessed. The total power consumption is measured by “smart energy meter” which uploads the information to the app provided to the user.
