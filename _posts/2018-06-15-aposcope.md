Developed a smart oscilloscope system using Arduino and Processing Software. The Arduino pins were used as input for accepting signals, the signals were then displayed and processed using Processing software.

An oscilloscope is a laboratory instrument commonly used to display and analyze the waveform of electronic signals. In effect, the device draws a graph of the instantaneous signal voltage as a function of time.
