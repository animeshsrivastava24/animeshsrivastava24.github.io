This project presents a self-learning Predictive Path Analyzer(PPA) system that helps re-route the vehicles causing
traffic jam on roads, aids priority vehicles in reaching their desired destinations,generates road safety awareness and provides
real time monitoring to vehicle owners, thereby creating a convenient path for priority vehicle and thus, mitigating jam
conditions ,delay for emergency vehicles and road accidents.

The proposed solution determines road traffic density using global positioning system and Google map data, and analyze
the priority vehicles and general vehicles present on the road.A cross platform application is developed that uses an efficient
path determination algorithm developed using Machine Learning technology which provides alternate routes to users present
on the road. Also, the path conditions are monitored for crevices and bumps using accelerometer,gyroscope sensors,Internet of
Things and cloud computing technologies, this helps in prevention of road accidents and reduces delay in reaching destination.
