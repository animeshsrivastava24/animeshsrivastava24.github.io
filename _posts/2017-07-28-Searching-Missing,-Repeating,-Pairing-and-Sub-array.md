### 1. Given a array containing numbers from 1 to n with one missing and one repeating element. Find the missing and repeating?
### 2. Given a **sorted array**, find the repeating element from the array.
### 3. Given an **unsorted array**, find the repeating element from the array.
### 4. Find repeating element and it's count 
### 5. Learn how to take I/P of two array from `Stdin` and place them in a single array.
For example:

```c
I/P
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
```
O/P
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
